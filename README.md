# Portfolio / Social media overview HTTP template

A simple website to give an overview over the social media platforms you're active on, as well as useful links about yourself. It features an icon-tile based design which is easily expanded with new social media platforms. 

To use this template simply change the TODO lines in the HTML files and leave a reference to the original repository.


This template is a stripped down and modified version of an older version of [Casper Verswijvelt's website](https://github.com/CasperVerswijvelt/CasperVerswijvelt.github.io), done by [Robin De Bock](https://github.com/RobinDeBock/robindebock.github.io/).
